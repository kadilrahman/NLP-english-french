## Objective

The goal is to develop a machine learning model capable of translating English sentences into French. This involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning models to understand the semantics of the English language and generate corresponding French translations.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of English and French sentence pairs. It is loaded and preprocessed to split the sentences into words and convert them into numerical representations that can be fed into a neural network. The dataset is extracted from a ZIP file containing a text file (fra.txt) with English-French sentence pairs.

## Approach

The project follows these steps:

Data Preprocessing: The English and French sentences are extracted, tokenized, and converted into a format suitable for training. This includes lowercasing, removing special characters, and adding start and end tokens to sentences.

## Model Building:

Text Vectorization: Converts text inputs into integer sequences. This is done for both the source (English) and target (French) languages.

Encoder-Decoder Architecture: The core of the model, consisting of an encoder that processes the input sentences and a decoder that generates the translated sentences.

The Encoder uses a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) layer to process the input sequences.

The Decoder also uses a GRU layer and incorporates an attention mechanism to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating each word of the output sequence.

Attention Mechanism: Allows the model to weigh the importance of different input words for each word in the output sentence, improving the quality of the translation.

Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset and evaluated based on its ability to translate new sentences from English to French.

## Key Components and Libraries

TensorFlow & TensorFlow Text: For building and training the deep learning model and preprocessing text data.

Einops: Used for more readable tensor operations.

Numpy & Matplotlib: For data manipulation and visualization.

## Code Highlights
